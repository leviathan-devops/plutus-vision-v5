## 1. What exists now
| Subsystem | Current truth | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Repository | clean root; 0 dirty paths; branch step_agent | git status |
| Baseline floor | operator-approved v1 checkpoint preserved | baseline sha below |
| Authority corpus | 5.3.3 prompt and corrected E3 authority only | `Original_Canon_Data/` |
| Design | v5 blueprint and workflow installed | `design/` |
| Execution contract | M1 golden-week-only contract installed | `m1/EXECUTION_CONTRACT.md:17` |
| Git enforcement | pre-commit, commit-msg, and reference gate installed | `gates/commit_gate.py:454` |
| External grader | Mimo v2.6 flash, threshold 7, vision control PASS | `gates/controls/mimo-vision-control.json:1` |

## 2. Exact hashes

## 3. M1 state machine
```
EVIDENCE_READY
  -> E1_CARD_VALID
  -> COMPOSITION_BUILT
  -> PINEBOX_RENDER_OBSERVED
  -> ORACLE_COMPARISON_COMPLETE
  -> INDEPENDENT_VISUAL_PASS
  -> M1_COMPLETE
  -> OPERATOR_REVIEW_REQUIRED
```
Current state is before `EVIDENCE_READY`. No card, composition, Pinebox M1 render, or oracle comparison exists yet.

## 7. Graph state
The old in-project PLUTUS_VISION graph was archived with the pre-v5 tree. The current graph is a new self-contained central graph scoped to the clean authority surface.
| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| scope | clean live authority files only; archive excluded |
| L1 | 30 entities and 78 relationships |
| L2 | 35 nodes, 78 edges, 7 components |
| diagnostics | own scope total 0 |
| anchors | 19/19 cards resolve |
| registry | `KNOWLEDGE_GRAPHS/INDEX.md` row present |

## 8. Current source-of-truth precedence
| Precedence | Source |
|---|---|
| 1 | operator rulings in `MASTER_CONTEXT/OPERATOR_RULINGS_PV.md:1` |
| 2 | v5 blueprint and workflow for architecture/execution |
| 3 | M1 execution contract for commit/checkpoint mechanics |
| 4 | gate policy/code for mechanical enforcement |
| 5 | fresh knowledge graph for indexed navigation |
| 6 | frozen archive for historical explanation only |

## Operating question matrix
| Question | Answer |

## Appendix interpretation
- This appendix is measured from the live clean tree and fresh graph; it is not historical narrative.
- A `NOT STARTED` family state is the current truth, not a defect in the substrate.
- External Pinebox and graph paths are dependencies, not editable project files.
